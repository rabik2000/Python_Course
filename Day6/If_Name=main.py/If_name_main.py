# if __name__ == __main__: (this script can be imported OR run standalone)
#                           Functions and classes in this module can be reused
#                           without the main block of code executing
# Good practice (code is modular,
#                helps readability,
#                leaves no global variables,
#                 avoids unintended execution)
