# 2 Dimensional List: It is a list made up of lists.
# 2DList = [List 1, List 2, List 3]

# The mentioned below are all 1-Dimensional lists.
fruit = ["apple", "orange", "banana", "coconut"]
veggies = ["celery", "carrots", "potatoes"]
meats = ["chicken", "fish", "turkey"]

#Now to create a 2-D list, we first have to create a 1-D list first.
groceries = [fruit, veggies, meats]

#The 0th Index is the first List, 1 is second list and so on
# print(groceries[2])

#Now if I want to print a value from a List then we need 2 [][]
print(groceries[2][2])   # thisprints only turkey
#You can sorta say like co-ordinates
